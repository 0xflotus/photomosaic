[x] func(path): load png emoji from disk
[x] func(path): load background image from disk
[x] func(img, m): chop image into m x m squares and return in list of lists
[x] func(img): return closest image from candidate set by euclidian
[x] func(img, h, w) resize image
[x] scrape popular emojis
[ ] func(img) -> dominant RGB color

Ideas:

1) Could try replacing transparent areas of emoji patch-in with dominant color from that BG patch
2) Limit emojis to just the popular ones - will require a manual run through... (or scrape of that page earlier?)
3) faiss / annoy installation for faster generation
